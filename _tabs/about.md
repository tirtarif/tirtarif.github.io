_Bismillah_,

_Assalamu'alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh_


Hi, my name is Arif Tirtana, and you can call me Arif or Tirta. I am from Sungguminasa, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. I received my master's degree in Plant Breeding and Biotechnology from Bogor Agricultural University (IPB University), with research topics on upland rice, multilocation trials, biotic and abiotic stresses, and multivariate analysis. 

Currently, I am working as an Assistant Lecturer at the Department of Seed Industry Technology, School of Vocational Studies, IPB University. My academic interests consist of conventional breeding, quantitative genetics, experimental design and data analysis. In the future, I would like to study molecular approach (Marker-Assisted Breeding & QTL) and meta-analysis techniques in plant breeding and seed science.

I actively participate in digital competency improvement programs, such as Prakerja and Digital Talent Scholarship. Both programs are organized by the Indonesian government. At the time of writing this post (2023-12-30), I am currently enrolled in the Bertelsmann and Udacity Next Generation Tech Booster Program, as well as the Prakerja and Microsoft Talent AI: Data Analytics Program.

In my free time, I learned Python, RStudio and Tableau to support my research activities, especially in data analysis and visualization. I also play _Stardew Valley_. That's some information about myself; I hope what I write and share on this site is useful to you. 

_Wassalamu'alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh_
